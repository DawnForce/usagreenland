    <section>
      <p>
        Economic integration between the United States and Greenland is no longer a
        theoretical discussion. It is emerging as a practical, multi-layered process
        shaped by infrastructure investment, resource development, security alignment,
        and long-term strategic interests in the Arctic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than a single agreement or policy decision, integration is unfolding
        incrementally—through capital flows, operational partnerships, and institutional
        cooperation that tie Greenland more closely into U.S. and allied economic systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>From Strategic Interest to Economic Presence</h2>
      <p>
        U.S. engagement in Greenland has historically been driven by security and
        geopolitical considerations. In recent years, however, that strategic posture
        has increasingly translated into economic presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Investment attention has expanded beyond diplomacy into tangible areas such as
        airport modernization, port feasibility, telecommunications resilience, and
        early-stage resource development. These efforts are not framed as short-term
        extraction plays, but as foundational steps toward long-horizon economic
        participation in the Arctic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Infrastructure as the Integration Backbone</h2>
      <p>
        Physical infrastructure is the most visible signal of integration. Airports,
        ports, energy systems, and logistics corridors determine whether Greenland can
        function as an isolated economy or as an integrated Arctic node.
      </p>

      <p>
        U.S. involvement—often alongside allied partners—has emphasized dual-use
        infrastructure: assets that support civilian economic activity while also
        enhancing regional resilience and security. This alignment reduces friction
        between commercial viability and strategic necessity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Capital, Governance, and Risk Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        Economic integration is not defined solely by investment volume. It also depends
        on governance compatibility, regulatory clarity, and risk alignment between
        public and private actors.
      </p>

      <p>
        For U.S. firms, Greenland presents both opportunity and constraint: a resource-
        rich environment with a small population, sensitive ecosystems, and strong local
        governance expectations. Successful integration therefore favors patient capital,
        transparent partnerships, and projects designed to scale responsibly over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Implications for Long-Term Growth</h2>
      <p>
        If current trends continue, U.S.–Greenland economic integration is likely to
        deepen unevenly but steadily. Infrastructure and logistics will lead, followed by
        selective expansion into resources, services, and technology-enabled operations
        suited to Arctic conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The defining feature of this integration is restraint. Rather than rapid
        commercialization, the trajectory favors durability—projects that strengthen
        Greenland’s economic independence while embedding it more securely within allied
        economic networks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        The next phase of U.S.–Greenland economic integration will be shaped less by
        announcements and more by execution. The pace at which infrastructure comes
        online, partnerships mature, and capital remains committed through early
        challenges will determine whether integration remains symbolic or becomes
        structural.
      </p>

      <p>
        For policymakers, investors, and operators alike, Greenland is no longer a
        peripheral market. It is a test case for how economic integration functions in
        strategically sensitive, environmentally complex regions—where long-term
        alignment matters more than short-term returns.
